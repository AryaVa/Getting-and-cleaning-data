# Getting-and-cleaning-data
This is a repo created for the course project or peer-graded assignment for the course "Getting and cleaning data". 

Files: 1) Codebook.md- Contains the description of all the variables defined in the Rscript where the code is written and other changes made to clean up the raw data.
       2) run_analysis.R- Contains the code along with explanation of each function used. The code performs the following actions when run:
          a)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
          b)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
          c)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
          d)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
          e)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
       3) Finaldata.txt- The text file of the 'Finaldata' exported, going through all of the sequences described above.
